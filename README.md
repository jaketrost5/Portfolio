# [Project 1:  Dallas Real Estate Price Analysis & Predictor: Project Overview](https://github.com/jaketrost5/Texas-Price-Analysis-and-Price-Prediction)
Built a data pipeline in Python to clean, process, and analyze real estate listings in Dallas, TX.
Engineered features (price per sqft, log-price, outlier filtering) to improve modeling accuracy.
Conducted EDA to identify price drivers such as size, baths, beds, and location patterns.
Trained a baseline Linear Regression model achieving moderate predictive performance (RMSE ≈ $60K).
Created visualizations including pair plots, scatterplots, and predicted vs. actual price charts.
Outlined future improvements (geospatial modeling, advanced ML, and external datasets).

# [Project 2:  Marvel Comic Price Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/jaketrost5/MarvelComics)
Analyzed 5,600+ cleaned Marvel comic issues after processing a raw dataset of ~28,000 rows.
Standardized messy metadata (ratings, dates, formats, cover artists, pencilers, and writer names).
Performed EDA to uncover publishing patterns, creator frequency imbalance, and price clustering.
Engineered features and trained a linear regression model (RMSE ≈ $0.63), predicting price based on metadata.
Built clear visualizations (rating distribution, release trends, price histogram, predicted vs actual).
Summarized key insights showing the limits of metadata-only modeling and identified next steps (variant detection, richer datasets, classification models, advanced ML).

# [Project 3:  Fitbit Tracker Data Analysis:  Project Overview](https://github.com/jaketrost5/bellabeat-case-study)
Analyzing smart device usage to identify customer behavior patterns.
Cleaned and processed Fitbit-style activity tracking data (steps, sleep, calories, intensities).
Performed EDA to identify trends in daily activity, sleep habits, sedentary behavior, and calorie expenditure.
Created polished visualizations in R/Python showing user engagement patterns across weekdays and time of day.
Developed insights and recommendations for Bellabeat’s product strategy (notifications, habit loops, app features).
Designed a full analytical report structured like a real stakeholder business presentation.
