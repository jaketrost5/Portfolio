# [Project 1:  Dallas Real Estate Price Analysis & Predictor: Project Overview](https://github.com/jaketrost5/Texas-Price-Analysis-and-Price-Prediction)
Built a data pipeline in Python to clean, process, and analyze real estate listings in Dallas, TX.
Engineered features (price per sqft, log-price, outlier filtering) to improve modeling accuracy.
Conducted EDA to identify price drivers such as size, baths, beds, and location patterns.
Trained a baseline Linear Regression model achieving moderate predictive performance (RMSE ≈ $60K).
Created visualizations including pair plots, scatterplots, and predicted vs. actual price charts.
Outlined future improvements (geospatial modeling, advanced ML, and external datasets).
